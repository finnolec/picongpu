 * Configure laser profiles. All laser propagate in y direction.
 *
 * Available profiles:
 *  - None                : no laser init
 *  - GaussianBeam        : Gaussian beam (focusing)
 *  - PulseFrontTilt      : Gaussian beam with a tilted pulse envelope
 *                          in 'x' direction
 *  - PlaneWave           : a plane wave (Gaussian in time)
 *  - Wavepacket          : wavepacket (Gaussian in time and space, not
 *                          focusing)
 *  - Polynom             : a polynomial laser envelope
 *  - ExpRampWithPrepulse : wavepacket with exponential upramps and prepulse
 *
 * In the end, this file needs to define a `Selected` class in namespace
 * `picongpu::fields::laserProfiles`. A typical profile consists of a
 * laser profile class and its parameters. For example:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * using Selected = GaussianBeam< GaussianBeamParam >;
 * @endcode
