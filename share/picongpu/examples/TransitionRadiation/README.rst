TransitionRadiation : Transtion Radiation
=============================================

.. sectionauthor:: Finn-Ole Carstens <f.carstens (at) hzdr.de>

This example simulates an electron bunch moving in a 45Â° angle in the x-y plane and calculates the coherent and incoherent transition radiation created by this bunch.
The implemented transition radiation follows the studies from [Schroeder2004] and [Downer2018].
The transition radiation is computed for an infinitely large interface perpendicular to the y-axis of the simulation.
The result can be interpreted with the according python script `lib/python/picongpu/plugins/plot_mpl/transition_radiation_visualizer.py`.
