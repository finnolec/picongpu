TransitionRadiation : Transtion Radiation
=============================================

.. sectionauthor:: Finn-Ole Carstens <f.carstens (at) hzdr.de>

This example simulates the transition radiation created by an electron bunch.
The implemented transition radiation follows the studies from [Schroeder2004] and [Downer2018].
The transition radiation is computed for an infinitely large interface perpendicular to the y-axis of the simulation.

The electron bunch in this setup is moving with a 45Â° angle in the x-y plane with a Lorentz-factor of $\gamma = 20$.
The bunch has a Gaussian distribution with $\sigma_y = 3.0 \mu m$.
The results can be interpreted with the according python script `lib/python/picongpu/plugins/plot_mpl/transition_radiation_visualizer.py`.
